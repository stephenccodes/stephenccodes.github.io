It has the variables ‘Red’, ‘Green’, ‘Blue’, ‘nir08’, and ‘swir12’. These variables represent energy bands, and the last two variables have unique names but are assumed to represent near-infrared and short wave infrared bands. I found the coordinate reference system(CRS) used and printed the height(731) and width(870) of the dataset. I listed the data types for each variable, as well as the geographic boundary of the data.\n\n\nDrop the band dimension of the data:\n\n# Remove the first dimension(band) and drop the associated coordinates\nlandsat = landsat.squeeze().drop_vars('band')\n\n\n\nSelect the red, green, and blue variables and convert it to an array and plot it:\n\n\nAdjust the scale used for plotting the bands to get a true color image and plot it again:\n\n# Remove the exterem values caused by cloud cover and plot it again\nlandsat[['red', 'green', 'blue']].to_array().plot.imshow(robust = True)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA note on extreme outliers in your data:\nInitially, my plot displayed all of the values present, including extreme values caused by clouds or other interference. These extreme values affected the color scale, with most values rendering as either black or white. To remedy this, I adjusted to avoid the influence of these extreme values. When you set robust = True, the only values displayed are from the 2nd to 98th percentiles, allowing the color scale to better represent the meaningful range of values."

The area outlined in red represents the extent of the fire perimeter. This is a false color image, with Short Wave Infrared(SWIR), Near-Infrared(NIR), and Red energy bands being visualized with Red, Green, and Blue colors, respectively.\nThe burn scar is displayed as red, because newly burned land reflects strongly in SWIR bands. The areas of the map that have vegetation are depicted by green colors, as vegetation reflect near-infrared light strongly, with healthy plants reflecting more than stressed plants. Accordingly, since the chlorophyll in plants absorbs red light, very little of the repesentative blue is displayed here."

Stephen became passionate about environmental studies as an undergraduate at UC Santa Cruz, where he interned with the UC Natural Reserve System, working to restore coastal prairie habitat. After graduating with an Anthropology degree in 2014, Stephen worked in agriculture, first, at an agri-tech startup with a mission to transform local food systems through vertical hydroponic farms, and later, at an organic farm, where he served in a leadership position and developed efficient approaches to workflow and logistics with the goal of reducing waste and costly inputs. Stephen also earned a certificate in microscopy and soil science, developing expertise in the microbiological processes that underpin the distinct agricultural operations in which he has taken part. He is excited to use his skills in data analysis, statistics, and programming to deepen his knowledge of conservation, waste management, and agroecology. After graduate school, he intends to use data science to find practical solutions to universal problems."
